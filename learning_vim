I've decided to learn vim, first from vimtutorial, and then using viper, which I suspect will might be the best 
of both the emacs and vim worlds.  Here are the things that seem to be g?eat, bad, and weird, coming from the emacs world.

good:
elegantly simple forth-like model of command composition.
:! to call shell commands and :r !blah to insert the result of calling them is pretty great.  
  Need to think about what is needed to do this in emacs. 

bad:
backspace doesn't delete, just moves back.
arrow seems to insert weird characters rather than moving when in insert mode.
backspace won't go up a line.
oddly hard to do a series of edits within a line.
inconsistent placement of range/motion, I think?  3dw vs. :1,3s/foo/bar/g
