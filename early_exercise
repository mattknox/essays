One really surprising thing about going through a sale of some equity in a startup is how big a deal taxes are: obviously taxes are painful when you sell a bunch of stock, but the difference between the taxes on cleverly managed equity and poorly managed equity is large: if everything is income, you lose about half, and if it's all long-term capital gains, you lose maybe 20%.  Given that this is the case, and that if an employee early-exercised, they would always be in the most favorable tax treatment, why do companies not encourage all employees that get options to early-exercise?  It seems like it would raise the percent the employees kept from about 50-60 to about 80, which is equivalent to giving them about 1.5x as much equity.  Huge win for everyone but the government...so why don't companies do this?
