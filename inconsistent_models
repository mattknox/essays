maybe worth developing into an essay:

Say there are two people who want to work at your late-stage company:
1: someone who was once an early employee at some other startup, stayed there a long time, cashed out and now wants to take another swing.  He has no meaningful equity in your company.
2: someone who was employee #{1-20}, and has cashed out most/all of their equity.  He has no meaningful equity in your company.

Practically every company in the valley wants #1.  Such people tend to get great offers that involve management and strategy.
Many companies have policies to fire people of type #2.

The funny thing is, the only difference between these two people is that #1 has deep knowledge and experience in another company, and #2 has deep experience in yours.  Seems like either companies should allow employees of type 2 to stay, or require propsective employees of type 1 to invest.
