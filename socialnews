Unfinished essay fragment.

I've been part of several social news sites: slashdot, reddit, news.ycombinator.com, arclanguage.com/forum, lambda the ultimate, and a few others, and I have often observed the same dynamic:  an initially great community has excellent discussion, which causes the community to grow, after which the content is diluted and the conversations become uninteresting.  The only escape that I have seen from this decay curve is that taken by LambdaTheUltimate-don't get big.  news.ycombinator.com seems to be fairly good for now, but will likely suffer the same problems as the others.  Need to make one in which real-world achievements give you karma: I care a lot about linus torvalds' opinion on software and managing dev orgs, not as much about some random schmuck's.
