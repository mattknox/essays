pg wrote at one point that he felt that Computer Science was like yugoslavia, and that hackers, mathematicians, and people studying, eg., the behavior of big networks were all lumped together.

I find that even among the coders, there is a pretty strong division between software engineers, people who can hack up stuff quickly (and tend to do well in early-stage startups), and people who do algorithms work.
