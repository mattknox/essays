The freakonomics blog posted an <a href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/08/our-daily-bleg-the-old-roommaterent-dilemma">interesting question: how to split the rent on 3 unequal rooms within an apartment.</a>  This turns out to be fairly easy to solve, assuming that all rooms are affordable for all renters.  The algorithm for handling a 2-room apartment is almost trivial: either of the two renters sets the price of the two rooms, and the other chooses which room to rent.  For three or more renters, the solution is as follows:  have each renter perform their division of the value of the rooms.  Then, for each room, choose the highest bidder for that room.  The sum of the bids for the rooms will necessarily be greater than or equal to the total rent.  Then scale down the rent by the ratio of the sum of the bids to the total rent.
