mamihlapinatapai means "A look shared by two people, each wishing the other to initiate something that both desire but neither wishes to start".  It seems unlikely to me that English will steal this word, despite its manifest brilliance and surprisingly common applicability.  Is that because it is too long?  or that it is too many syllables?
