Ireland is pretty cool, but the most interesting bit about it by far is how some seemingly minor details make for really large changes in life.  For instance, the fact that mortgages are really risky here means that despite crazy house prices, no one buys houses that cost only 8x as much as their annual rent.  this is insane, and I'm sorely tempted to engage in real estate speculation.
