write up impressions of mexico.  So far:
-Only in the last 6 months were prescriptions necessary for some fairly hard drugs, eg. vicodin(!?).  Until recently, one would just go to a pharmacy and buy whatever one needed.
-mexican people seem to share the same latin american warmness and encouragement of nonnative spanish speakers that I have seen in Colombia and Cuba.  Maybe the Francophone countries really are an anomaly.
