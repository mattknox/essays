write up impressions of mexico.  So far:
-Only in the last 6 months were prescriptions necessary for some fairly hard drugs, eg. vicodin(!?).  Until recently, one would just go to a pharmacy and buy whatever one needed.
-mexican people seem to share the same latin american warmness and encouragement of nonnative spanish speakers that I have seen in Colombia and Cuba.  Maybe the Francophone countries really are an anomaly.  Or maybe it's just france.
-I have this strange interaction pattern with mexican women: they will see me and seem mildly disgusted -literally a look like I was something they found on the bottom of their shoe-and then I go up and talk to them and they seem to have a good time talking to me.  Either I'm misreading them or they are weird as hell.
