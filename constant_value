It seems, in my limited experience, that most startups hiring engineers tend to pick a constant present value of equity somewhere between $10K and $100K, and give their employees options on that much of the company.  This means roughly that everyone benefits equally from a constant multiple in company value (not quite true, because of the degree of dilution tends to be greater earlier, but close enough).
