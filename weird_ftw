I tend to be a bit off-center, and this, no doubt, has some costs.  But the fun is when I'm recognized in a context I normally would not be because of previous oddness...like being recognized at @carmenjyuen's holiday party by the lighting guy because I had worn the same kilt/jacket outfit to twitter's holiday party the week before.
