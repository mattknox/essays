Every internet company since AOL had to write a ton of infrastructure software, and most of the companies who did that shared a large common intersection.  Everyone had to write something like bigtable, everyone had to do something like trafficserver, etc..  The first few companies to do this had to come up with their own ideas, but google started publishing papers that contained the necessary ideas, and right now all the hot growing companies are doing their infrastructure opensource, which means that the big startup hit of 2020 will probably be able to avoid developing practically all of the software they use.

Is the natural endpoint of this process a chef/whatever recipe that installs a default-scalable stack, with kestrel, something gizzard/libdist-like that fronts whatever db you want, and lets you write app logic?  Can that be made generic enough?
