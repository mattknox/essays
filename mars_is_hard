A friend of mine just told me that he was frequently annoyed at how easy some software engineers of his acquaintence thought it would be to colonize mars.  He claimed they said something like "If there's ice, we can just harvest a bunch of water and start farming".  These people are sadly mistaken.  Farming on mars will be extraordinarily hard, unless we do an amazing amount of prep work, which would probably take far longer than anyone currently living on earth has left to live.

So what is needed to do farming?  Generally, soil, water, atmosphere, and plants that like the local versions of those.  The better-adapted to the local soil, water, and atmosphere the plants you're growing are, generally the less work farming will be.

Sadly, mars has sterile soil, very little water, and a pretty thin atmosphere.  That isn't fatal-you can farm in a pressurized strucutre, which would let


Farm equipment in absurdly heavy.  4 tons for a midsize tractor is not unusual.  Further, this is not a case where you can rely on tech to make things lighter, because you have to move dirt, and dirt is heavy, and to move heavy things you need to be stuck to something heavier or be heavier yourself.
