I've recently been working with a longterm friend who has a lovely pair of traits: while he has strong opinions he can be convinced to change them, and he remembers and credits the originator of the opinion.  This is obviously the right thing to do, but I've seen it done so rarely that I was shocked the first few times it happened.  I honestly don't know what my reaction will be the next time I deal with someone who takes the more conventional managerish approach of discounting and then appropriating an idea.
