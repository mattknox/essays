write up what I hope to do and be in this new year of 2012.
outline:
apps
writing
coding
exercise

I want this year to be the year of data for me: I'm tracking my diet, how much time I spend with Carmen, how work is going, etc..  In particular, I'm trying to get streaks going and form habits in at minimum the core areas of carmen, running, coding, diet, and writing.

It seems so far that it is fairly challenging to get things done after the morning, so I am going to try to start waking up and getting up earlier, and have to be better about taking more time for deliberate practice.
