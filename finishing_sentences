Why do people who spend a lot of time together finish one another's sentences?

The simplest answer seems like an analog to the birthday problem: if there are only so many things one is likely to say, and two people are talking around one another a lot, then there will be occasional collisions.  While it's true that even a relatively short sequence of random words is vanishingly unlikely to collide with another, our speech is far from random.  And people are pretty sensitive to the speech habits of their surroundings, so it is natural that a group of people who spent a lot of time together would have their speech converge somewhat.

But maybe it's more interesting than that.   It's pretty rare for people to actually say aloud the same thing at the same time.  And humans tend to justify behavior ex post facto, creating their very recent history as they go along.  So perhaps brains of people who feel a strong connection fabricate the "I was about to say the same thing!" sensation as some sort of social signalling.

Of course, as with most human behavior, it's probably both these things at the same time, and several others besides.
