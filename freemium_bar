Cash bars are OK: you can pay your money and get a drink.  Open bars are OK: you can wait a long time and get a free drink.  a bar that was cash at one end and free at the other would be _amazing_.  The people who wanted free drinks would go to one side and the people who valued their time would go to the other.  Also, it would still be possible to buy girls drinks.  The bar would also love it, given that half of the bar would be paying.  This seems like an obvious improvement for people running events, even in places where one could not get obvious serving-area level separation.
