It's surprising how hard it is to always remember how fortunate one is...I'm crazy bullshit lucky on nearly every axis-great job with a killer company, amazing group of friends, incredible girlfriend, and great relations with most of my family.  But it is still easy to forget that and obsess on some trivial detail.
