When I went to buy a utilikilt, I showed up 15 minutes before the store closed, stressed because I was about to miss my last opportunity to get one before the trip I wanted it for.  I looked at the closed storefront, vainly trying the door.  I heard a voice say "yo", and turned to see this black dude looking at me, not looking as if he had spoken.  "This is the voice of god", I heard from above me.  I looked up and saw a guy with a shaved head and the air of a burner.  The conversation went something like this:

"Sup?"
"I'm going to mexico tomorrow at noon and want to buy a utilikilt before then."
"OK, cool!  I closed the shop early because my girl and I were having a domestic, but I'll come back down and reopen, and you can be part of our domestic."

He came down with a black lab, a beautiful girlfriend, who had identified me as a likely customer by my toe shoes, and 3 beers.  He offered me one and it seemed only polite to take it.

I chose a kilt while they had an intense but still respectful argument about trust and boundaries and the guy's status as a kilt rockstor.  I made my choice, and the guy interrupted his argument to size me up and grab a kilt in the right size.  He told me to drop my shorts right there, and when I said that I didn't have anything on under the shorts, he didn't care.  So I did, noticing just then that the door to the shop was still open, and he showed me how to put the kilt on.  I paid for it and headed out.  Overall, it was the oddest and best retail experience I have ever had.
