Josh just told me about a bunch of really interesting, fairly obvious games that have been done recently, like rocksmith, which is basically guitar hero with a real guitar.  The game was apparently bought by a game company from an educational music software company, and shows the neck of the guitar where guitar hero has a bunch of buttons.
