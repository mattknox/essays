airbnb had a disasterously bad user trash a user's place, and there is now a pretty damaging public game of "he said, she said" going on.  It could probably have been averted if they had either gone public first, or had publicly offered to take care of her when she went public.  Would that have been a winning strategy?  Or should they just accept that there will be problems and figure that if they stay out of the way, people will still use the platform?
