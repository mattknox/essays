It's strange to me that checkin apps like foursquare and gowalla are so antisocial-they don't generally let you check in with others.  When I go out with 8 friends, if one of us checks in and labels the other 7, all 8 of us should be checked in and should get points/whatever.  This would be more engaging both for the person who checks in and for the others, and would obviously be great for the company who built the app.  I can't imagine why that isn't done.
