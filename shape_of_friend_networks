I was talking today with a friend who felt that he had had to sacrifice a lot on the social front to pursue his fulltime job + startup life-he observed that there was just no time to do the social grooming that he would otherwise have done.  While that is obviously true, I disagreed that this meant much for his friendships, in that both he and I tend to be the sort of people who can pick back up quickly with people who we have not seen in ages, but still feel a lasting connection to.
