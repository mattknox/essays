Very strange thought: the stereotypically "male" mode of communication - listening to someone talk and then suggesting a solution to a problem - actually demonstrates more understanding of what someone is saying than the more empathetic, stereotypically "female" mode of communication - listening and saying stuff like "yeah, that does suck.  You're totally underappreciated."  Might it be easier to simulate the stereotypically female mode of communication?
