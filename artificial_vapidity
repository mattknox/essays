Very strange thought: the stereotypically "male" mode of communication - listening to someone talk and then suggesting a solution to a problem - actually demonstrates more understanding of what someone is saying than the more empathetic, stereotypically "female" mode of communication - listening and saying stuff like "yeah, that does suck.  You're totally underappreciated."  Might it be easier to simulate the stereotypically female mode of communication?

a friend pointed out, quite correctly, that a huge amount of the communication that happens in the "comfort, don't solve problems" style of communication is outside the linguistic domain.  That bears thinking about, and might flip the conclusion.
