How will essays be different if they are version-controlled?  Certainly it will be possible for humans or machines to learn about the way in which they were constructed, and certainly they will tend not to get lost, will have interesting historical meta-data attached, etc., but will it change the way they are written?  I thinkthey will.  Changing almost anything about the process by which most things are done leaves its imprint on the product of that process, and I can't imagine writing would be any different.  Might I feel more free, as I get used to it, to kill off bad words or phrases, comfortable that I can always get them back?  I often have a sort of orphanage of lost phrases at the bottom of my essays, which probably doesn't help the writing.  Further, it will mean that I'll always be publishing, and reducing the iteration size has been a fairly reliable win in everything else I've done.  

The fact that the progress of my writing will be more easily tracked in an automated fashion is another great benefit-I can, for example, track my writing progress in whatever crazy way I want, and make feedback for myself.

How much more is there to know about setting up feedback loops for oneself?  Flow is probably the optimal state, and in flow, one has essentially no feedback at all-or do they?  Have to reread "flow" on that soon.
