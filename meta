How will essays be different if they are version-controlled?  Certainly it will be possible for humans or machines to learn about the way in which they were constructed, and certainly they will tend not to get lost, will have interesting historical data, etc., but will it change the way they are written?  Intuitively, I think the answer is yes.  Changing almost anything about the process by which most things are done leaves its imprint on the product of that process, and I can't imagine writing would be any different.  Might I feel more free, as I get used to it, to kill off bad words or phrases, comfortable that I can always get them back?  I often have a sort of orphanage of lost phrases at the bottom of my essays, which probably doesn't help the writing.  Further, it will mean that I'll always be publishing, and reducing the iteration size has been a fairly reliable win in everything else I've done.  Should everything be version controlled?  I begin to think that it may be a good idea.
