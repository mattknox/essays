I was just afforded the opportunity to see 2 very different schools in rapid succession: MIT and Olin.  Both are primarily or entirely engineering, and both are excellent.  They have very different foci, though:  Olin is relentlessly practical, and MIT tries to give an extremely thorough grounding in the theory of the subjects it teaches.  The students are also very different-the MIT kids are far more serious, and the Olin ones more playful.  It was an interesting contrast.
