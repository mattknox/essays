It's interesting to consider what a deliberate practice regimen looks like.  I talked to @noahlt about this, and he said that all of his deliberate practice experience was in classical violin, where he tended to do exercises targeting the mechanics of playing (scales, arpeggios, etc.) and then bits of pieces.  I'll have to investigate whether there are other components that are often used, and how to apply them to coding/making products.
