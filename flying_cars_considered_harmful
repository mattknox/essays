Retro-futurism confuses me.  Lots of people, including some smart ones, complain that we don't have flying cars.  I can see why they might be OK for a few hobbyists, but cannot imagine why you'd want them generally available.

For clarity, I'm using what I believe is the typical definition of "flying car": a mass-market vehicle that can be driven and piloted by humans on city streets and highways, and then also fly.  This seems to have been the idea since Henry Ford talked about it in 1940.  This is a phenomenally bad idea.

Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow notwithstanding, there aren't any examples of vehicles that handle two of water/land/air well, and most that try are amphibious rather than air/ground.  Flying cars would have to solve the following problems:
-flying things have to be light, cars have to be heavy for humans in them to survive collisions
-flying is pretty hard, and mass-market drivers are pretty terrible.
