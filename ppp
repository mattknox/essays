Purchasing-power-parity is really interesting, and has some odd consequences.  In particular, I think a society with a Basic Income Guarantee would have very high PPP GDP relative to their absolute GDP.  (flesh this out.)

More generally, what is the GDP effect of a basic income?  Also, is there a name for a hybrid of basic income and directly providing food/shelter?
