If you have an app that is a bigass collection of services, how should you compose them? IE, how do you tell service A that once it has done something, it needs to tell service B?  Offhand, I can think of the following fairly obvious answers:

-enterprise service bus
-registry
-inline in each individual service, code in the relevant calls.
-pub-sub event-based system
