about 4 years ago, I wrote up what I wanted to do and be in 2012.  Since then, I watched twitter IPO, got engaged and then married, and had a child with my wonderful wife @carmenjyuen.  It's probably harder and definitely more important now to improve myself, so I'm starting on what I want to change and improve early.

The idea that our habits shape who we are is both old and common-it goes back at least to Aristotle saying "We are what we habitually do".  My favorite phrasing of the idea is attributed to Charles Noble, and is "First we make our habits, then the habits make us.".
