about 4 years ago, I wrote up what I wanted to do and be in 2012.  Since then, I watched twitter IPO, got engaged and then married, and had a child with my wonderful wife @carmenjyuen.  It's probably harder and definitely more important now to improve myself, so I'm starting on what I want to change and improve early.

The idea that our habits shape who we are is both old and common-it goes back at least to Aristotle saying "We are what we habitually do".  My favorite phrasing of the idea is attributed to Charles Noble, and is "First we make our habits, then the habits make us.".  There has been some pretty good research about how long it takes to form or break habits (about 40/21 days respectively), how hard it is to form more than one at a time (very), etc..


Here is a growing list of habits I wish to have in 2016:
-jot down new thoughts every day
-flesh out at least one of those thought to a full essay per week
-write code every day
-work on my personal side project every day
-play with skylla every morning and evening
-eat healthily 6/7 days per week
-exercise several times per week (aiming for ketonic diet)
-manage more effectively my relationships with important-to-me people
