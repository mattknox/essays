The platform I wish a candidate would run on:

1: state a number of uncomfortable truths
  - america does not lead the world in the way it used to.
  - many tough things are on the horizon (climate change, income inequality, etc.)
  - politics is pretty broken in the US, and without changing that, it is hard to have lasting change.
  - in particular, the power of the president is somewhat limited by their ability to get things through congress
  - world esteem for america is lower than it was, and lower than it should be.

2: state the advantages
  - american universities are still the best in the world, by far
  - american startups lead the world, although that lead is narrowing.
  - the american military is still quite strong
  - no one has effectively stepped into the role that america once fulfilled (world cop, etc.)

3: certainly achievable goals
  - Shut down Guantanemo Bay as a prison (maybe OK to keep a base)
  - Stop security theatre (eg. TSA shenanigans)
  - Back the NSA down on the data collection.
  - reduce our prison population
  - radically increase govt transparency
  - make government APIs and encourage their use.

4: goals that require cooperation from agencies (maybe?)
  - stop war on drugs
  - stop war on terror
  - don't use military contractors
  - fix military procurement
