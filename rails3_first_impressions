The install of rails3 was rather painful, but that is perhaps an artifact of the fact that I have a rats-nest developer environment right now:  default mac ruby/gem/rails, ports, homebrew, cider, etc..  I should probably blow away the whole thing and start from a clean slate soon.

Application templates are really interesting, and exceptionally powerful.  I put the following in a file:
apply "http://gist.github.com/187990.txt"
apply "http://gist.github.com/187993.txt"

and run:
rails APP_NAME filename

to get rails to apply those  two templates in series.  This means you can stitch together a bunch of templates, which should make it very easy to generate custom generators out of small, modular parts.
