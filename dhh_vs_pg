dhh has a really interesting blind spot: he believes that crazy work ethic is not useful, but doesn't seem to notice that the really big stuff (google, fb, twitter, etc.) are always done by big companies taking VC and working like crazy.

more generally, I can think of 4 different arguments in favor of organic growth as opposed to big bang vc-funded startups:
1: the expected value to the founder/employees is higher. (highly speculative, very interesting if true)
2: the variance of the value is lower (this is certainly true, but it's basically a personal choice whether it's a good thing.)
3: the value generated for society by organic growth is greater. (extremely hard to justify)
4: DHH mentioned a "moral imperative".  I think it was tied to the societal value thing, above.  Should listen again and see.
