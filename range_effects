Weight is extremely correlated with getting into the NFL hall of fame as an offensive lineman if you select from the general population, but within the NFL, there is no correlation at all.  This seems related to the fact that the things one does to go from the 10th %ile to the 50th are very different from those needed to go from the 80th to the 90th.
