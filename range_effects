Weight is extremely correlated with getting into the NFL hall of fame as an offensive lineman if you select from the general population, but within the NFL, there is no correlation at all.  This seems related to the fact that the things one does to go from the 10th %ile to the 50th are very different from those needed to go from the 80th to the 90th.

This suggests that we should be very careful when saying, for instance, that financial incentives work or don't work for a given kind of task.  It could be that those incentives work well for the general population in mechanical tasks, but poorly for the very best performers.  Conversely, it could be that it's only mildly effective for the general population, but extraordinarily effective for top performers.

This same reasoning also needs to be applied when claims are made about, say, the inefficacy of a >40h work week.  It is very likely true that for the median worker in the median job, diminishing productivity sets in pretty early, maybe even before 40h.  But for the top 0.01%, it probably doesn't.  Anecdotally, there are a bunch of people who say that Elon Musk is about as effective after 18 hours of work as he is after 6.  If productivity was normally distributed, this would be an ignorable outlier.  But if productivity is more of along-tail type distribution, then it matters a ton, because a disproportionate share of all the productivity is in these outliers.
