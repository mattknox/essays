I've been pairing with a pair of designers for the last few days, and it has been fascinating: I am pretty clueless about most of what they do, and they are likewise not so up to speed on cacheing and backend stuff.  I think I am going to spend weekends swapping pairing with one of them in the next few months, as he wants to learn to code and I could stand to learn a lot more about designing.

One really striking difference, to my mind, is how terrible the tools for designers are.  I must have watched the designer who sat next to me move a box up and down in photoshop a billion times.  Unbelievable.
