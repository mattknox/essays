It's pretty surprising to me that there isn't a place where the current scientific consensus on a given topic is collected and graded.  For example, how strongly does the community of quantum mechanics experts believe that the bell inequality is inviolable?  How about climatologists on climate change?  That homeopathy is bunk?  My understanding is that all of these have pretty high degrees of certainty on all of these.  It would particularly be interesting to be able to look at how opinion on a given topic (say, the likelihood of hostile AI) varies across discipline.  A really useful property of a system like this would be to let both individuals and disciplines be graded for how likely they are to be correct: turns out that the psychologists that said everything is a social construct and tried to raise a chimp as a human were Just Wrong, as were physicists who tried to drag their heels about accepting the weird conclusions of quantum mechanics.
