I used to work for a company called Direct Revenue.  While I was there, I worked in the several departments, most interestingly the one called "Dark Arts".  A lot of the work was somewhat morally suspect, in that it basically relied on human stupidity and laziness for profit.  

I was broke and unemployed for a while, and became interested in spam-filtering software around the time Paul Graham wrote A Plan for Spam.  Around that same time, I got an interview with an adware company in New York, to be an analyst in their distribution department.  I was to figure out where their distribution chain broke, and thus how to optimize it.  

A note about adware: the business model of the company was basically find a bit of software that unsophisticated users might want (screen savers, etc.), and buy it, then offer it with an ad client.  Then the company shows ads on that user's computer and hopefully makes some profit.  None of this is particularly controversial.  However, the distributors of adware, which tend not to be the companies showing the ads, sometimes get installs by using browser exploits, etc..


.....to be used later on:
I've thought a fair bit about what what sort of laws would have prevented the kinds of shenanigans that happened in my department.  It's a really weird case that I don't think is particularly amenable to legislation.  Certainly users should be able to install software.  They don't want to pay for anything (at least, most of them want a bunch of stuff they don't want to pay for),
