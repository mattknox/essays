Twitter has a really amazing office manager/current HR person called Cheryl Palarca, who was the first person I saw when I showed up for my interview and continues to be a ray of sunshine every day I see her at work.  For some reason, in mid-2009 I started greeting her with a ridiculous accent and emphasis on her name, saying something like "MADAM Palarca, how do you do?  The tweets are quite fine today.".  She's always a good sport, so she replies "MISTER Knox...they are indeed."

I ran across this old email exchange, in which I asked her for my health card info.  The exchange was as follows:

SIR KNOX...

'Tis my pleasure to inform you that your HSA card has been resent to your home address...arrival expected within 7-10 business days.

Please do inform me of its timely arrival.

I bid you adieu, good sir.
-M. Cheryl

MADAM Palarca,

It is with utmost and continuing pleasure that I thank you for your wrangling of the labyrinthine and baroque bureaucracy of the health provider.  I feel healthier already, merely having read that you wish me to be so.


Best email I've read in a LONG time!

"... wrangling of the labyrinthine and baroque bureaucracy..."

FAVORITE'ed!


It's surprising how big a deal such interactions are, in making work more of a home, more of a family.  I'd do just about anything for most of my coworkers, particularly the ones who have been with the company for a long time.  This sort of thing is why.
