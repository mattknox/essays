What defines a startup?  Foosball tables and informality are surface manifestations, but I think a more fundamental characteristic is the shape of the distribution of outcomes, specifically, the huge difference between the mean and the median result.  For most companies, the median result is that they do about the same this year as they did last year.  For startups, the median result is that the startup ceases to exist.  From this falls nearly everything there is to know about startups: the speed, the risk tolerance, the intense work ethic, and the distrust of process.  

What sort of distributions have the property that the mean is the same as the median?  The flat distribution and ones that are rotationally symmetric do, do any others?  Is it perhaps more important that the standard deviation is large?
