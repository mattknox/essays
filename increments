I try to spend about as much time polishing a given thing (code, process, personal competency) as you spent solving a problem caused by a deficiency in that same thing.  This is the general case of Eric Reis' Five Whys method, and is generally pretty useful.

A similar idea is setting a ratchet on a metric.  This measures a given thing and defines a direction in which it is allowed to move.  Then you only allow changes that go in the right direction.
