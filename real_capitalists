real capitalists house the homeless:  las vegas guy cost $1M/year in hospital bills, not much to have an attendant and keep a job, etc..

Also:  companies are legally bound to seek out profit, but it isn't the case that companies often radically change the business they're in (ford doesn't become a shaved ice company, etc.).  This has a really interesting consequence:  Founders, who are not bound to seek profit, can determine what the company is, and then the company generally cannot change much what that is, so it stays that way.  It seems that if lots of founders started companies of a given type, there would tend to remain a lot of companies of that type (modulo acquisitions, etc.), if the market supported it.
