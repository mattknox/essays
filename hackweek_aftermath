I was incredibly lucky to get a great designer, @kyledoherty, to work on my team for twitter hackweek 2012, and our project (#replay) won.  Further, we got to take a second swing at it to make it be a live thing in time for the superbowl, a riduculously tight deadline that we seem like we might be able to hit.  Crazy, and awesome.
