It is almost a cliche that ideas don't matter and execution does, but there are some notable counterexamples.  Twitter is probably the best, in that the company had incredibly poor execution (slow hiring and hardware scaling early, slow product iteration in the middle, and CEO/product leadership churn throughout).  So clearly execution isn't the only thing in all cases, or twitter would have ceased to exist a long time ago.
