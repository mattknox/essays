I write an app generator, goaloc, that compiles from a very terse description of a web application to an actual app.  One of my coworkers jokes that he should just be able to say 

goaloc blog

and be done, with a newly generated blog.  This is obviously silly, except that it isn't.  A large number of apps have very similar featuresets:  photo galleries, blogs, wikis, status update queues, etc.  Code generators like restful-authentication in rails have demonstrated that a full-stack MVC widget has at least some utility, and I believe the concept could be much more useful.  In particular, this sort of component is extremely powerful in the REST world.
