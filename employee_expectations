I think that a lot of employee angst with companies, including mine in the past, stems from 2 unreasonable expectations on the part of employees:

1: that companies will have your best interests (eg., future development) at heart.
2: that companies will use you near-optimally within the organization by default.

1 is just silly, but 2 is seductive, and much more dangerous.
