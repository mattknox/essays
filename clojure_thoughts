nil-punning and laziness are mutually exclusive.  <= really? not sure why.

nice collection interface:

conj count seq

really interesting-you can have the list (1 2 3 <lazy list starts here>)
most stream libs have lazy-cons, lazy-car, lazy-cdr, etc. clojure doesn't need them.

destructuring is exceptionally powerful, and the clojure collections libraries are also.
also, clojure seems to be on more platforms than normal:  jvm, clr, and js.
