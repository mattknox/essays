I've heard that in seattle, everyone is exstatic when the sun comes out, once or twice per year.  I observed the same effect myself in Dublin-it's often cloudy, but when the sun battled through the clouds, I noticed a significant change in my mood.  But on the other side, people who live in San Diego must surely know that their weather is basically perfect all the time, no?  (perhaps not-San Francisco has pretty great weather almost all the time, at least in the mission, but people still complain-maybe Randall Munroe is right in http://xkcd.com/915/ and everyone fits all their experience to the same scale.)
