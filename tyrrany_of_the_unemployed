develop this further:
Reddit/digg/slashdot/HN, and to some extent quora, suffer from the fact that winning karma there is essentially a grinding game, and people who get shit done generally don't have much time to grind, so the top-karma people are generally not very accomplished.  This has a _really_ strong effect on what the community esteems, and therefore what the users become.  It would be really interesting if there were such a discussion community that was not a 1-user-1-vote democracy, but rather a weighted democracy based on magnitude of outside contribution (1-github-star-1-vote or some such).
